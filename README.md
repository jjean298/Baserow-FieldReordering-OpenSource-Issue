# Baserow-FieldReordering-OpenSource-Issue
Editors and lower are triggering an API call with a confusing error. When trying to reorder fields, they should receive an error. However, the error states that an unknown error occurred. when it should explicitly state that they don't have permission to reorder field or perform this action.
